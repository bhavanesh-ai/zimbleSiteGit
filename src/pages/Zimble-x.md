 ### Product Information Management(PIM) 
</div>

**PIM & OMS in the Ecosystem**

A Product Information Management (PIM) system houses crucial information such as product descriptions, titles, specifications, images and pricing that the OMS relies on, and the OMS tends to hold important order information such as order status, tracking information, and inventory adjustments that the PIM may need, so it’s crucial to ensure these systems are integrated and communicating efficiently.  
Integrating a PIM system with an OMS ensures real-time data exchange, where the PIM provides up-to-date product information to the OMS for accurate order processing, while inventory levels and order status updates from the OMS keep product availability current across all sales channels. 
Product Information Management (PIM) for Zimble
PIM module for Zimble should address the efficient management, synchronization, and utilization of product information across various systems such as ERPs, Marketplaces, and other integrations (e.g., BigCommerce, Shopify, and AP21). Below is a structured approach to designing PIM functionality:
Business Goals of PIM in Zimble
Centralize product data to ensure consistency across systems.
Streamline workflows like product imports, updates, and synchronization.
Enhance data accuracy to reduce manual errors and improve marketplace performance.
Enable flexibility for customizing product attributes and handling complex configurations like buffers or inventory rules.
Support seamless integration with existing ERP and marketplace systems.

## AWS Lamda Function

</div>

AWS Lambda is a **serverless compute service** that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You simply write the function code, specify when it should be triggered, and AWS handles the execution. You only pay for the actual compute time your code consumes, and you don't have to worry about scaling or infrastructure management.

Let’s break down AWS Lambda with an example to make it easier to understand.

**Example **Scenario:**** Image Resizing for an E-commerce Platform

Imagine you run an **e-commerce website** where sellers upload product images. You want to automatically resize every image to multiple dimensions (like thumbnails, medium size, etc.) for optimal use across the website. Instead of manually processing images or maintaining a server for this task, you can use **AWS Lambda** to automate the resizing.

**How AWS Lambda Works in This **Scenario:****

1.  **Trigger**:
    *   Whenever a seller uploads an image to an **S3 bucket** (AWS’s object storage service), the image upload event will **trigger** the Lambda function.
2.  **Execution**:
    *   Whether 10 images are uploaded in a day or 10,000, Lambda automatically scales up to meet the demand..
3.  **Serverless**:
    *   **No Server Management**: You don’t need to maintain a dedicated server to handle image uploads and processing. Lambda only runs when there’s a new image to process.
4.  **Cost Efficiency**:
    *   You only pay for the compute time while the function is running. If no images are uploaded, there are no charges.

 **AWS Step Functions**

**AWS Step Functions** is a service that enables you to coordinate and manage workflows across multiple AWS services. It allows you to define and visualize workflows as state machines, helping to orchestrate the execution of multiple AWS Lambda functions, AWS services, and custom microservices into a single workflow. Step Functions are highly scalable, serverless, and reliable, making them great for building complex workflows with retry mechanisms, error handling, and parallel processing.

**How AWS Step Functions Work:**

1.  **State Machine**: The workflow is defined as a state machine, where each state represents a task (such as running a Lambda function, waiting, or invoking an API call).
2.  **Task Execution**: Each step can be a task (like calling a Lambda function), a decision (based on conditions), a parallel task (running multiple tasks simultaneously), or even a wait state (delaying execution).
3.  **Coordination**: AWS Step Functions coordinate the flow between these tasks, handling retries, failures, and passing output between steps.
4.  **Visual Workflow**: You can visualize the entire workflow, monitor each step's progress, and check for errors or retries.

# Use Cases of AWS Step Functions in **E-commerce**

AWS Step Functions can play a key role in automating, orchestrating, and managing complex processes within an e-commerce platform. Let’s explore some common e-commerce scenarios where Step Functions can be highly beneficial.

**1.Order Processing Workflow**

In e-commerce, when a customer places an order, several steps are involved in processing it: validating the order, checking inventory, processing payment, confirming shipment, and notifying the customer. Each of these steps involves various systems and services.

**How Step Functions Can Help**:

*   **Orchestrating Microservices**: Each of these tasks (inventory check, payment processing, order validation) might be handled by different microservices or AWS Lambda functions. AWS Step Functions can coordinate these tasks in a reliable sequence.
*   **Error Handling and Retries**: If any step fails (e.g., payment authorization fails), Step Functions can automatically retry or trigger compensation logic (e.g., cancel the order or notify the user).
*   **Parallel Processing**: If multiple tasks can be done simultaneously (e.g., validating inventory and calculating shipping), Step Functions can handle them in parallel, reducing the overall time.

**Example Workflow**:

*   Customer places an order.
*   Step Functions start:
    1.  **Validate Order**: Ensure the order details are complete.
    2.  **Check Inventory**: Confirm items are in stock.
        *   If out of stock, notify the customer.
    3.  **Process Payment**: Call the payment gateway and handle the transaction.
        *   If payment fails, retry or cancel the order.
    4.  **Confirm Shipment**: Communicate with the shipping provider to arrange delivery.
    5.  **Send Notification**: Notify the customer about the order confirmation and estimated delivery.

**2.Inventory Management and Restocking**

Managing inventory in real-time across multiple warehouses or fulfillment centers is critical for e-commerce. AWS Step Functions can automate the workflow of checking stock levels and triggering restocking when necessary.

**How Step Functions Can Help**:

*   **Automated Restocking**: Step Functions can be triggered when the stock level of a product falls below a certain threshold. The workflow might include checking inventory across multiple locations, placing restocking orders, or notifying the procurement team.
*   **Real-Time Sync with External Systems**: If your inventory is managed by external systems (e.g., a third-party logistics provider), Step Functions can coordinate API calls to update your internal system in real time.

**Example Workflow**:

*   Step Functions monitor stock levels via periodic checks (using AWS Lambda or DynamoDB triggers).
*   When stock for a product is low:
    1.  **Check Other Warehouses**: Step Functions can query different fulfillment centers.
    2.  **Restock Decision**: If stock is available elsewhere, initiate transfer. If not, place an order with the supplier.
    3.  **Notify Team**: Send notifications to the team about stock levels and restocking actions.
    4.  **Update Inventory System**: Update the system to reflect stock movements or expected delivery times.

**3.Payment Processing Workflow**

In e-commerce, payments often involve multiple steps such as validation, authorization, and settlement, and might require interaction with multiple systems, such as fraud detection services or third-party payment gateways.

**How Step Functions Can Help**:

*   **Orchestrating Payment Gateway Interactions**: Step Functions can call external payment gateways (such as Stripe or PayPal), handle multi-step authorizations, and ensure payment completion.
*   **Handling Payment Failures**: If a payment fails, Step Functions can implement retry logic or trigger compensating actions, like reverting inventory reservations or notifying the user.
*   **Fraud Detection**: Before authorizing a payment, Step Functions can integrate with fraud detection services. If any risk is detected, it can put the transaction on hold and notify the security team.

**Example Workflow**:

*   Step Functions begin after the customer submits payment:
    1.  **Validate Payment Details**: Call the payment gateway to validate card details.
    2.  **Fraud Check**: Integrate with a fraud detection service to analyze the transaction.
    3.  **Authorize Payment**: Proceed with payment authorization.
    4.  **Settlement**: Trigger the settlement process.
    5.  **Notification**: Send confirmation to the customer or alert on payment failure.

**4.Customer Support Automation**

AWS Step Functions can be used to automate customer support workflows. For example, if a customer raises an issue (like requesting a refund or tracking a missing package), multiple systems need to interact to resolve it.

**How Step Functions Can Help**:

*   **Multi-step Support Tickets**: Step Functions can automate complex workflows like checking order details, processing refunds, and updating customers on resolution progress.
*   **Escalation Handling**: If an issue isn't resolved within a specific time frame, Step Functions can escalate it to higher-tier support teams or managers.
*   **Integrating Chatbots**: Step Functions can coordinate between chatbots (like an Amazon Lex chatbot) and backend systems, ensuring that user queries are processed by the right service and information is retrieved efficiently.

**Example Workflow**:

*   Customer requests a refund through an automated chatbot:
    1.  **Validate Order Details**: Check the order ID and eligibility for a refund.
    2.  **Process Refund**: Call the payment gateway to process the refund.
    3.  **Update Inventory**: If applicable, reverse the inventory allocation.
    4.  **Notify Customer**: Send a confirmation email or SMS to the customer about the refund.

 **5. Order Fulfillment**

Coordinating order fulfillment (especially in a multi-warehouse system) involves several steps, such as packing, shipping, and updating the order status.

**How Step Functions Can Help**:

*   **Multi-step Fulfillment Workflow**: Step Functions can manage each stage of order fulfillment. Once an order is placed, it could manage inventory updates, packing requests, shipment generation, and real-time order status updates.
*   **Shipping Coordination**: Integrating with third-party logistics providers or internal systems for tracking packages and notifying customers of shipping updates can all be managed by Step Functions.

**Example Workflow**:

*   After an order is confirmed:
    1.  **Pick and Pack**: Communicate with the warehouse management system to pack the items.
    2.  **Generate Shipping Label**: Connect to the shipping provider’s API to create shipping labels.
    3.  **Notify Customer**: Send shipment confirmation and tracking information to the customer.
    4.  **Update Order Status**: Mark the order as shipped and close the fulfillment process.
